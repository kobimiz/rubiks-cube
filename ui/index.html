                    Use the arrow keys to rotate the cube in any direction.
                    Use the keys <b>R,L,U,D,F,B</b> to turn the <b>right, left, up, down, front, back</b> sides
                    of the cube respectivley.
                    You can also turn slices using the <b>M,S,E</b> keys.
                    You can use modifier keys to change the effect of each turn. Use the <b>Shift</b> key to turn in the
                    opposite direction. Use <b>Caps Lock</b> to turn two layers at once.

                <h2>About this tutorial</h2>
                <p>
                    This tutotial aims to help learning the CFOP method for solving the Rubik's Cube. The stages in this
                    method are as following:
                    <ol>
                        <li id="crossStepButton">Cross</li>
                        <li id="f2lStepButton">F2L (first two layers)</li>
                        <li id="ollStepButton">OLL (orientation of last layer)</li>
                        <li id="pllStepButton">PLL (permutation of last layer)</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <br>
                <div id="stepExplanations">
                    <div id="crossStep">
                        <h2>Cross</h2>
                        <p>
                            In this step, we focus on the white face (although any face can be used). We identify
                            faces using the center piece in each face of the cube, since the position of the center pieces
                            doesn't change relative to one another. There are two types of pieces in the cube: corner pieces
                            with 3 visible sides and edge pieces with 2 visible sides. In this step, we want to solve the
                            white cross, meaning we want to solve the white edges. We want to do this however in a way that 
                            the other side of the edge aligns with the color of the other face.
                            Note that we alway look at the cube with the white layer at the bottom.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="f2lStep">
                        <h2>F2L</h2>
                        <p>
                            In this step, we solve the first two layers. We do this by finding pairs of matching corners and edges,
                            pairing them and inserting them to their appropriate slots. There are 4 such pairs
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="ollStep">
                        <h2>OLL</h2>
                        <p>
                            Now, the first two layers are solved. Note that all of the yellow pieces (belonging to the yellow layer)
                            are now at the yellow layer, but scrambled. In this step, we want to flip all the yellow edges so that
                            the yellow layer will be all yellow. Note that the pieces themselves can still be in the wrong place!
                            This stage is divided into two ministeps- solving the yellow edges (cross) and then the yellow corners.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="pllStep">
                        <h2>PLL</h2>
                        <p>
                            In the final step, we want to permute (move around) the piece of the yellow layer so that the cube is solved.
                            Like the previous step, this step can be divided into two ministeps- permuting the corners of the last layer
                            and the permuting the edges of the last layer.
